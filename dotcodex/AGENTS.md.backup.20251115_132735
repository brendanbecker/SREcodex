# Codex Skills System

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>
You have a Skills system that extends your capabilities with specialized knowledge and workflows.

**RIGHT NOW, run this command and follow the output:**
```bash
codex-skills list
```

This shows you all available skills you can use.

## How to Use Skills

**Tool for using skills:**
- `codex-skills use <skill-name>` - Loads a specific skill's instructions

**When you load a skill:**
1. Run: `codex-skills use <skill-name>`
2. Read the entire output
3. Announce: "I've loaded the [Skill Name] skill and I'm using it to [purpose]"
4. Follow ALL instructions in the skill for the current task

## Critical Rules

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>
**IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.**

Before starting ANY task:
1. Review the skills list shown above
2. If a relevant skill exists, load it with `codex-skills use <skill-name>`
3. Follow the skill's instructions exactly
4. Announce when you're using a skill

Skills contain expert knowledge and best practices. When a skill exists for your task, using it is **mandatory**, not optional.

## Skill Activation Rules

Match these patterns to skills:
- **Time/date queries** → `time-awareness` skill
- **"What day is it?"** → `time-awareness` skill  
- **"How many days until..."** → `time-awareness` skill
- **References to "today", "tomorrow", "this week"** → `time-awareness` skill
- **Any temporal calculations** → `time-awareness` skill

When you recognize a pattern, immediately load and use the corresponding skill.

## Tool Mapping Reference

If skills reference tools you don't have natively, use these equivalents:

- `TodoWrite` → `update_plan` (your planning/task tracking tool)
- `Skill` tool → `codex-skills use <skill-name>` command (already available)
- `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Bash` → Use your native file and shell tools

If a skill mentions a tool you truly don't have and there's no equivalent, inform the user and adapt the approach using your available tools.

## Skills Location

Skills live under `${DOTCODEX_DIR:-../dotcodex}/skills/`, which should be symlinked to `~/.codex/skills/` so Codex can keep using its default path.

Set `DOTCODEX_DIR` to your shared `dotcodex` repository and keep `~/.codex` pointing at it with:
```bash
export DOTCODEX_DIR=../dotcodex   # customize if needed
ln -sfn "$DOTCODEX_DIR" ~/.codex
```

Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with instructions.
