  "description": "Build the infrastructure to upgrade the Librarian from keyword search to semantic search using ChromaDB as a local vector store and a custom MCP server as the bridge to Codex. The ingestion pipeline parses YAML frontmatter, embeds the intent field, and stores full skill documents for retrieval. The MCP server exposes a search_skills() tool that converts natural language queries to vectors and returns complete, executable skill files—solving the RAG chunking problem where partial code retrieval breaks functionality.",
  "business_value": "high",
  "technical_complexity": "high",
  "user_impact": "Enables natural language skill discovery with semantic understanding, dramatically improving search relevance over keyword matching"
