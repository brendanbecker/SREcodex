  "description": "Enable complex, high-volume operations to succeed by forcing the agent to write and execute a single script rather than attempting chat-based iteration one command per turn. This requires updating config.toml to enable workspace-write sandbox mode and adding a standardized directive to relevant SKILL.md files. This pattern also handles skill composition—when a task requires multiple skills, Claude writes orchestration code that calls them together.",

  "user_impact": "Enables reliable execution of bulk operations and complex multi-skill workflows that previously failed or timed out"
