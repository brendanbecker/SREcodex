  "description": "Create a foundational 'Librarian' skill that enables lazy-loading of capabilities on demand, replacing the current approach of statically listing all available skills in the context window. When the agent encounters a task outside its currently loaded context, the Librarian searches the skills repository (initially via grep/find), reads the relevant SKILL.md, and dynamically acquires the capability. This reduces context bloat, improves relevance, and establishes the behavioral pattern for intelligent tool discovery.",
