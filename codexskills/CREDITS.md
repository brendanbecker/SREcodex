## Jesse Vincent - Superpowers

This project is based on [Jesse Vincent's Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers), which introduced the Skills concept for AI coding assistants.

**What we learned from Jesse's work:**
- Using SKILL.md files with YAML frontmatter
- The three-component architecture (discovery, loading, bootstrap)
- How to make skills discoverable with `when_to_use` fields
- Tool mapping between different AI assistants
- That Codex is excellent at following skill instructions

Thank you, Jesse, for building this, sharing it openly, and documenting your approach so well.
